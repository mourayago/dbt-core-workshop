Educational repository with the purpose of storing learning about dbt

## What is dbt?

dbt (data build tool) is an open-source tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouse more effectively. It allows you to write modular SQL queries, manage dependencies between them, and version control your transformations using Git. With dbt, you can define your data models as code, test data quality, and generate documentation automatically, all following software engineering best practices. It integrates with modern data warehouses like BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, and others.
